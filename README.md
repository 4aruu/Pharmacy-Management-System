# Doctor Appointment Booking System  

This project, developed using **Java** in the **Eclipse IDE**, is an **admin-use-only system** designed to streamline the scheduling and management of doctor appointments. All doctor and patient data is managed directly in the **MySQL database**, providing secure and centralized record-keeping.  

## Features  

- **Appointment Management**  
  - Book appointments based on doctor availability.  
  - Update or delete existing appointments.  
  - View all appointment records.  

- **Doctor and Patient Data Management**  
  - Doctors and patients are added or updated directly via the MySQL database.  
  - Only admin users have access to the system.  

- **Database Integration**  
  - Data is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database using **MySQL Connector for Java**.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: Eclipse  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Connector**: MySQL Connector/J

## Usage  

1. **Manage Appointments**  
   - Use the system to:  
     - Book appointments with doctors based on availability.  
     - View or delete existing appointments.  

2. **Add or Update Data in MySQL**  
   - Add doctors and patients directly via the MySQL interface:  
     ```sql  
     INSERT INTO doctors (id, name, specialization, availability) VALUES (1, 'Dr. John Doe', 'Cardiology', true);  
     INSERT INTO patients (id, name, age, contact) VALUES (1, 'Jane Doe', 30, '123-456-7890');  
     ```  
   - View data using queries like:  
     ```sql  
     SELECT * FROM doctors;  
     SELECT * FROM patients;  
     ```
